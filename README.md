# RealDebrid Interceptor

A Chrome extension that automatically debrids and downloads hoster or torrent links via your RealDebrid account upon clicking.

## What is RealDebrid?

[RealDebrid](https://real-debrid.com/) is a platform that makes downloading both torrent and centralized files so much easier. It eliminates the need for multiple premium subscriptions to sites like 1fichier or DuckDuckGo, offering unlimited downloads at speeds up to 1000 GB/s. Ideal for private torrent downloads or when facing a lack of seeders, RealDebrid also caches torrent files. If another user has requested a file within the last two weeks, it can be downloaded directly from RealDebridâ€™s servers at maximum speed.
